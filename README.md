Project Specifications 
Introduction: This project involves deploying a photo-sharing website using Amazon Web 
Services (AWS). The website allows users to upload, browse, and delete images, with 
media content limited to images. The key AWS services used include Amazon S3 for 
storage, DynamoDB for the database, and Amazon EC2 to host the web application. 
Objectives: 
• Interpret specifications and analysis performed. 
• Create a new Amazon S3 bucket to store media files. 
• Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to run the web server. 
• Create an Amazon DynamoDB database for data storage. 
• Ensure the system provides basic features like browsing, uploading, and deleting 
content through a web interface. 
Specifications: 
• Amazon EC2: A resizable compute service designed to make web-scale cloud 
computing easier. 
• DynamoDB: A managed NoSQL database service for storing and retrieving any 
amount of data at any level of request traffic. 
• Amazon S3: An internet storage service designed to make web-scale computing 
easier for developers. 
Requirements: 
1. Create an Amazon S3 Bucket: Store media files such as images. 
2. Create the Media Database: Use DynamoDB to store and retrieve metadata 
about the media files. 
3. Create the Web Front-End: Develop a user-friendly interface for uploading, 
browsing, and deleting images. 
4. Create a Security Group: Restrict access to the server's resources by defining 
security rules. 
5. Test the Deployment: Ensure that all components are correctly deployed and 
functioning as expected.
